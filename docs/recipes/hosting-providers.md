# Hosting Providers

We typically serve 4 main hosting providers:
- Acquia (`acquia_hosting`)
- Pantheon (`pantheon_hosting`)
- Platform.sh (`platform_hosting`)
- Forum One (`f1_hosting`)

We have recipes for each that make it easy to install the required modules. At this time there's no additional configuration shipped
with the recipes so these don't do much other than require composer dependencies and enable them.

Be sure to check out their README files as there are still manual steps that need to be taken after applying the recipes.
